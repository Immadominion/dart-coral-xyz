# Dart Anchor Event System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The Dart Anchor event system has been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive event listening, parsing, filtering, and subscription management capabilities that mirror the TypeScript Anchor event system.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Event Types (`lib/src/event/types.dart`)

- **EventContext**: Context information for event emissions (slot, signature, blockTime)
- **ParsedEvent<T>**: Typed parsed event with context and metadata
- **LogsNotification**: WebSocket log notification structure
- **EventFilter**: Filtering events by name, program ID, slot range
- **EventStats**: Event processing statistics and metrics
- **EventSubscriptionConfig**: Configuration for event subscriptions
- **EventReplayConfig**: Configuration for historical event replay

### 2. Event Parser (`lib/src/event/event_parser.dart`)

- **EventParser**: Parses transaction logs and yields events
- Program execution context tracking
- Log-based event extraction
- Integration with BorshEventCoder for data deserialization

### 3. Event Manager (`lib/src/event/event_manager.dart`)

- **EventManager**: WebSocket connection and subscription management
- **LogsSubscription**: Individual log subscription handling
- **AccountSubscription**: Account-based event subscription
- Automatic reconnection logic
- Connection state management
- Event distribution to listeners

### 4. Event Subscriptions (`lib/src/event/event_subscription.dart`)

- **EventSubscription**: Base subscription interface
- **EventSubscriptionImpl**: Concrete subscription implementation
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Statistics tracking per subscription

### 5. Event Listeners (`lib/src/event/event_listener.dart`)

- **PausableEventListener**: Pausable event handling with buffering
- **BatchedEventListener**: Batches events for bulk processing
- **FilteredEventListener**: Advanced event filtering
- **HistoryEventListener**: Maintains event history
- **EventListenerBuilder**: Builder pattern for creating listeners

### 6. Event Filters (`lib/src/event/event_filter.dart`)

- **EventCriteria**: Base interface for filtering criteria
- **EventNameCriteria**: Filter by event names
- **SlotRangeCriteria**: Filter by slot ranges
- **ProgramIdCriteria**: Filter by program IDs
- **CompositeEventFilter**: Combine multiple criteria with AND/OR logic
- **CustomEventCriteria**: Custom filtering functions
- Advanced filter composition and metrics

### 7. Event Replay (`lib/src/event/event_replay.dart`)

- **EventReplay**: Historical event processing from logs
- **ReplayProgress**: Progress tracking for replay operations
- **SlotRangeReplay**: Replay events from specific slot ranges
- **BatchReplayProcessor**: Batch processing of historical events
- Concurrency control and progress reporting

## Key Features

### ✅ Event Listening Infrastructure

- WebSocket-based real-time event listening
- Automatic reconnection with configurable retry logic
- Multiple subscription types (logs, accounts)
- Connection state management and monitoring

### ✅ Event Processing

- IDL-based typed event parsing
- Borsh deserialization integration
- Event data validation and error handling
- Multiple callback patterns (single, batched, filtered)

### ✅ Advanced Filtering

- Multi-criteria event filtering
- Composite filters with boolean logic
- Custom filter functions
- Filter performance metrics

### ✅ Event History and Replay

- Historical event replay from transaction logs
- Slot range-based replay
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Concurrent processing with backpressure

### ✅ Developer Experience

- Type-safe event handling
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive configuration options
- Builder patterns for complex setups

## Integration

The event system is fully integrated with the main Anchor client:

```dart
import 'package:coral_xyz_anchor/coral_xyz_anchor.dart';

// All event system components are available
final parser = EventParser(programId: programId, coder: coder);
final filter = EventFilter(eventNames: {'Transfer'});
final config = EventSubscriptionConfig(commitment: CommitmentConfigs.confirmed);
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite with 13 tests covering:

- Event type creation and validation
- Event filtering and matching
- Parser initialization and log processing
- Subscription configuration
- Replay configuration
- LogsNotification handling

All tests pass successfully.

## Example Usage

See `example/event_system_example.dart` for a complete example demonstrating:

- Event parser setup and usage
- Event filtering configurations
- Listener pattern implementations
- Statistics and monitoring
- Replay configuration

## Next Steps

The event system is now ready for production use. To connect to real Solana events:

1. Set up a WebSocket connection to a Solana RPC endpoint
2. Create an EventManager with your connection
3. Subscribe to program logs or account changes
4. Handle events with your preferred listener pattern

## Architecture Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Full type safety with Dart's null safety
- **Performance**: Efficient event processing and filtering
- **Flexibility**: Multiple listener patterns for different use cases
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and reconnection logic
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and monitoring
- **Developer Experience**: Builder patterns and extensive configuration options

The Dart Anchor event system now provides feature parity with the TypeScript implementation while leveraging Dart's strengths in type safety, async programming, and cross-platform support.
